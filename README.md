# Future Salary Prediction

This project predicts future salaries based on a given dataset using basic Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It is designed as a beginner-friendly machine learning project without using any advanced frameworks like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze historical salary data
- Visualize salary trends
- Predict future salaries based on years of experience using linear regression

# Technologies Used

- Python: Core programming language
- NumPy: For numerical operations and calculations
- Pandas: For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
- Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting

# Dataset

The dataset used is a simple CSV file containing:
'YearsExperience': Number of years of work experience
'Salary': Corresponding annual salary

You can download a sample dataset from Kaggle or use your own. In this project, I used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.

# Methodology

1. Data Loading: Import CSV data using Pandas.
2. Data Visualization: Plot the relationship between experience and salary.
3. Manual Linear Regression: Use NumPy to implement a simple linear regression model manually.
4. Prediction: Predict salaries for new experience values.
5. Evaluation: Compare actual vs predicted results on a simple plot.
